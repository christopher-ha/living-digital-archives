# Living Digital Archives

An archive of the deleted personal websites on Yahoo! GeoCities in the context of modern web frameworksâ€”capturing the tension between a lost past and a distant future. 

I had always wished you could see new art when you revisit a museum, so I developed an interactive digital exhibition that automatically updates with new worlds by extracting the images from a Tumblr bot that uploads a screenshot of a deleted Yahoo! Geocities website every 5 minutes.

You can paste your Tumblr URL and create a world with your photos/reblogs.

Images sourced via Tumblr bot: <a href="https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/">oneterabyteofkilobyteage</a> <br>
Developed with Next.js (react framework) / react-three-fiber (3d / three.js) / Tumblr API (data fetching).
